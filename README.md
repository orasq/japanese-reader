## About
Small project using React, Apollo, GraphQL and MongoDB.

---

As a learner of the japanese language, one of my main challenge is to make my way through its daunting writing system made of thousands of characters.
The best way to achieve this is rather simple in itself: read, read and read. But not that easy to put into practice.

To make it easier, I'm heavily relying on a great Chrome extension called Rikaikun, allowing me to check instantaneously the reading and meaning of any word I encounter in a text.

I recently found an enormous collection of .txt files from old classic japanese books and novels whose copyrights had expired.
But in order to be able to read them with the help of Rikaikun, the texts needed to be diplayed on webpages.

The role of this simple React app is to allow me to create my own digital library of texts I'm eager to read.

## What's next?
One of the main next step is to implement the same functionalities as the Rikaikun extention directly in the app.
